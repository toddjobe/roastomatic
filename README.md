Coffee Roasting using ESP32

I had a 4$ hot air popcorn popper that I used in 2005 for roasting coffee.  My roasting was atrocious.  I waited 20 years and people across the internets got a lot a smarter about roasting coffee at home.  So, I thought if I added bit more smarts to my hot air popcorn popper, i *might* make a decent roast.
